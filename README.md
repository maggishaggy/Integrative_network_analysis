# Integrative_network_analysis
This repository contains the scripts for the integrative framework that uses protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and anatomy ontology data to study evolutionary phenotypic transitions. Furthermore, the scripts that were used for the module analysis are inclueded as well.

The scripts are organized into following categories based on the steps of the integrative framework.

Pre-processing

Costruction of anatomy-based gene networks

Integration with the PPI networks

Network-based candidate gene prediction

Evaluation of the network performance

Module analysis

Network Statistics scripts
